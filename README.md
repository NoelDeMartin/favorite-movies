# My Favorite Movies

This is a list of my favorite movies hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), declared with RDF, and allegedly readable by [Solid Apps](https://solidproject.org/).

I don't think this is 100% compliant with the Solid specification. For example, the index is declared with a `.html` extension so that it is served on the root url, and the `Content-Type` header is returned as `text/html` (instead of `text/turtle`). But this is a proof of concept on how this kind of thing is possible. I had [a conversation in Mastodon](https://kosmos.social/@colby/105650506657088266) that sparked this experiment.

If you want to see a Solid Application reading this information, check out the following url: [https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/viewer?c=https%3A%2F%2Fnoeldemartin.github.io%2Ffavorite-movies%2F](https://noeldemartin.github.io/media-kraken/viewer?c=https%3A%2F%2Fnoeldemartin.github.io%2Ffavorite-movies%2F)
